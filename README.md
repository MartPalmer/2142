A game based on the 1942 classic game. 

Each class has been created for each object in the game. These are then used within the main game file. Enemies are randomly generated
and progressively generate more quickly over time. The speed of each ship is random. The main ship can be moved around the screen using the 
keyboard. The player can shoot with the enemy ships destroyed and the score increases. 

To be improved - Enemy ships should be able to randomly shoot back. In addition, randomly dropped bonuses should increase speed/health. Finally
I would like to include a health meter to add extra challenge.
